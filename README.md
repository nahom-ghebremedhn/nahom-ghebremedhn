Hi there 👋  

I'm Nahom, a computer science undergraduate studnet.

I have a strong interest in software development and problem-solving.

I enjoy building projects that help me understand how real-world systems work and how to design clean code.

I’m looking for software engineering internships where I can learn and grow technically.
